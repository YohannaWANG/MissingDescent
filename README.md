# Learning Sparse Gaussian Graphical Model from Incomplete Data

## TODO: Problem formulation

Assume known missingness mechanism, can we recover both the structufe and parameters of the Gaussian graphical model with small error.
1. Missing Completely At Random, value is missing with some probability \alpha;
2. Missing At Random. One fully observed variable lead to the missingness of another variable.
3. Missing Not At Random. Hidden variable(s) lead to the missingness of a fully observed variable.
